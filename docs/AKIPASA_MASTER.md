## 2026-10-25 | Rental photo caption contrast

The selected vehicle name on the rental detail dark photo surface uses explicit
white text in light and dark themes. Global heading tokens must not override
that surface's foreground. No interaction, URL, identity, booking, pricing,
media, permission or provider behavior changes. See the impact register for
validation and release limits. Source revert is sufficient.

## 2026-10-24 | Native shared account journey

AkiCoches now serves its own shared profile/settings forms and retains local
account and membership navigation. All editable fields use one atomic UPDATE
to the authenticated identity's existing public.profiles row; explicit column
validation excludes IDs, roles, entitlements and billing. Email changes and
password recovery use trusted same-product callbacks and the existing identity.
Name, username, bio, contact, locality/province, language and visibility therefore
follow the account across products without syncing copies or sharing cookies.
The form is withheld after a failed profile read; no blank overwrite is offered.
EN/ES, existing product shells, tenant permissions, saved/booking records and
separate identity/privacy safety gates remain authoritative. No SQL, provider
config, purchase activation or customer data is changed by the source release.
Shared source v1 mirrors have no sibling repository imports. Regression tests
cover both locales, field bounds, role/foreign-ID stripping and failed reads.
Full check/build, hosted CI and exact live-source acceptance remain required.
Rollback is a source revert; profiles and sessions are retained.

## 2026-10-24 | Native accounts and shared billing bridge

Routine account/settings/membership screens now belong to each product while
reading and modifying the same authenticated profiles row. AkiBusiness selects
its package and creates a private location locally, without a public-venue claim
or the Pasa→HQ chain. Coches/Duermo free management links target their actual HQ
branch/property tools. The central bearer-only `/api/account/portal` verifies
Supabase identity, eligibility and terms, reads only caller billing, preserves
existing management-only portal configuration and returns Stripe to the fixed
originating product. Customer/profile/return URL inputs are not accepted. No
service key, cross-domain cookie, checkout activation or paid entitlement change.
Bilingual new tests cover native profile forms, role/ID stripping, billing identity
isolation, fixed destinations, partial failures, location idempotency and local
logout. See `CUSTOMER_JOURNEYS_20261024.md` for all eight journeys, dependency/release
order and explicit remaining shared safety/onboarding and provider acceptance.

## 2026-10-25 | Shared icon family v3

Owner-requested burgundy Coches (#3B101B) and space-grey HQ (#252830) tiles
are synchronized across all five product selectors, favicons, Apple/PWA and
mobile icon sources. Coches uses the current car-free mark; black artwork has
a fine brand-colour edge for legibility. Pasa, Duermo and the purple AB geometry
are preserved. Default dark canvases match the tiles; light and selected owner
themes remain available. Versioned URLs and the static operating suite cache
refresh remove stale selector artwork. Stable PWA IDs and app identifiers remain.
No roles, links, data, billing, analytics, storage or provider configuration change.
See AKISUITE_ICON_FAMILY.md for dependencies, checks, native rebuild limitations
and source-only rollback. Local visual/asset validation and required CI are
separate from exact-source production and signed native-device acceptance.

## 2026-10-25 | AkiSuite navigation and surface continuity

Owner-authorized tightening preserves identity, tenant permissions, booking and
billing authority. Discovery membership audience now survives explicit Business
handoffs, reload and browser history without enabling checkout. Duermo/Coches
share one desktop rail/mobile dock component where available; Coches membership
retains its product header. Pasa's auth selector uses all five canonical brands
and origins. Duermo auth stays teal; HQ marketing and login use one request
language, keep readable dark-surface text, and expose header controls. Business
login gains local home/language/appearance controls retaining input only in memory.
Each repository carries only its affected subset. No schema, feature activation,
provider setting, customer record or native signing change. Source revert is the
rollback. Full source, browser/CI and exact production checks remain required;
device/authenticated acceptance must not be inferred from fixtures.

## 2026-10-25 | AkiSelector workspace login integration

Alex explicitly selected the existing private lab's AkiSelector for the public
login workspace chooser. All five apps appear: Pasa orange, Duermo teal,
Coches red/burgundy, HQ yellow/space grey and Business purple. Reuse the
engine's card scene, swipe, keyboard navigation and reduced-motion behavior
in a compact sign-in adapter. Previewing an app never submits, navigates or
replaces a login form; opening another app is an explicit localized action
with only the bounded referral code passed across origins. Current product
is selected initially. Mobile keeps the chooser after the sign-in fields.
The static operating app uses a DOM adapter and the same scene styles, with
no framework runtime or third-party dependency added. The private lab keeps
its administrator-only route. No pricing, session, tenant, permissions or
provider setting changes. Source revert is rollback. Source, responsive
browser, exact live source and physical device acceptance remain distinct.
