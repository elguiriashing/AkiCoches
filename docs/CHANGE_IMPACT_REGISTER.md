# Product contract

## 2026-10-24 | Native shared account journey

AkiCoches now serves its own shared profile/settings forms and retains local
account and membership navigation. All editable fields use one atomic UPDATE
to the authenticated identity's existing public.profiles row; explicit column
validation excludes IDs, roles, entitlements and billing. Email changes and
password recovery use trusted same-product callbacks and the existing identity.
Name, username, bio, contact, locality/province, language and visibility therefore
follow the account across products without syncing copies or sharing cookies.
The form is withheld after a failed profile read; no blank overwrite is offered.
EN/ES, existing product shells, tenant permissions, saved/booking records and
separate identity/privacy safety gates remain authoritative. No SQL, provider
config, purchase activation or customer data is changed by the source release.
Shared source v1 mirrors have no sibling repository imports. Regression tests
cover both locales, field bounds, role/foreign-ID stripping and failed reads.
Full check/build, hosted CI and exact live-source acceptance remain required.
Rollback is a source revert; profiles and sessions are retained.

## 2026-10-24 | Native accounts and shared billing bridge

Routine account/settings/membership screens now belong to each product while
reading and modifying the same authenticated profiles row. AkiBusiness selects
its package and creates a private location locally, without a public-venue claim
or the Pasa→HQ chain. Coches/Duermo free management links target their actual HQ
branch/property tools. The central bearer-only `/api/account/portal` verifies
Supabase identity, eligibility and terms, reads only caller billing, preserves
existing management-only portal configuration and returns Stripe to the fixed
originating product. Customer/profile/return URL inputs are not accepted. No
service key, cross-domain cookie, checkout activation or paid entitlement change.
Bilingual new tests cover native profile forms, role/ID stripping, billing identity
isolation, fixed destinations, partial failures, location idempotency and local
logout. See `CUSTOMER_JOURNEYS_20261024.md` for all eight journeys, dependency/release
order and explicit remaining shared safety/onboarding and provider acceptance.
